## Recent Updates

### Citation Link Implementation - 2025-06-11
**Category:** Content
**Status:** Completed

Added citation links to research reports to ensure proper attribution and traceability. The implementation modifies the `baseResearchReport.ts` file to append a "References" section with markdown-formatted citation links to the end of research reports generated by the MCP tools.

### Transaction Management Fix - 2025-05-26
**Category:** Infrastructure
**Status:** Planned

Fixed a critical issue in the search indexing system where nested transactions were causing the indexing process to fail with the error: "cannot start a transaction within a transaction". The solution modifies the transaction management approach to prevent nested transactions while maintaining backward compatibility.

### Search Indexing Implementation - 2025-05-26
**Category:** Infrastructure
**Status:** Planned

Added a file-based search indexing system using SQLite with FTS5 to make research-archive and url-content-archive contents searchable and usable for augmenting future research requests. The solution emphasizes quality over performance, periodic indexing, and citation traceability.
