# Docker Implementation for Research MCP

## Purpose
This document outlines the addition of Docker infrastructure to the Research MCP project, enabling containerized deployment and consistent environments across different systems.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Infrastructure
- **Stability:** Semi-stable
- **Abstraction:** Structural
- **Confidence:** Established

## Content

### Overview
Docker containerization was added to the Research MCP project to simplify deployment, ensure environment consistency, and provide a standardized way to run the service. This implementation follows best practices for Node.js applications in Docker environments.

### Implementation Details

#### docker-compose.yml
The docker-compose.yml file placed in the project root provides a complete environment definition for the Research MCP server:

- Uses multi-stage building for optimized image size
- Maps standard ports (3100) for the MCP server
- Configures volumes for persistent storage of research archives
- Includes health checking for better monitoring
- Uses environment variables from .env file for configuration

#### Dockerfile
The Dockerfile in the src directory implements several best practices:

1. **Multi-stage build** - Separates build environment from runtime environment for smaller images
2. **Specific base image** - Uses node:20-alpine for a small footprint
3. **Dependency optimization** - Leverages npm ci and --omit=dev for production
4. **Security practices** - Runs as non-root user (node)
5. **Health checks** - Includes container health monitoring
6. **Volume preparation** - Creates appropriate directories for persistent data

### Configuration

Environment variables are passed to the container through the .env file. The docker-compose setup supports both development and production environments with appropriate settings.

### Design Decisions

1. **Alpine-based Image** - Chosen for minimal footprint and smaller attack surface
2. **Non-root User** - Enhances security by running as the node user
3. **Volume Mapping** - Ensures research data persists between container restarts
4. **Health Checks** - Enables container orchestration systems to monitor application health
5. **Multi-stage Build** - Reduces final image size by separating build and runtime environments

### Technical Considerations

- **ENV vs ARG** - Used ENV for runtime configuration that should persist in the container
- **Dependency Optimization** - Used npm ci for reproducible builds and --omit=dev for smaller images
- **Directory Structure** - Created proper directory structure within the container for data persistence

### Future Improvements

1. Potential future implementation of development-specific docker-compose configuration with hot reloading
2. Possible additional services (database, caching layer) if project scope expands
3. CI/CD pipeline integration for automated builds and testing
