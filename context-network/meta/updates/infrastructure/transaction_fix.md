# Transaction Management Fix Update

## Purpose
This document records the update to fix the nested transaction issue in the search indexing system.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Infrastructure
- **Type:** Bug Fix
- **Status:** Planned
- **Priority:** High

## Content

### Overview
A critical bug was identified in the search indexing system where nested transactions were causing the indexing process to fail with the error: "cannot start a transaction within a transaction". This update addresses this issue by modifying the transaction management approach in the CitationGraph component.

### Changes Made
1. Created a decision document: [decisions/transaction_management_fix.md](../../decisions/transaction_management_fix.md)
2. Created an implementation plan: [planning/transaction_fix_implementation_plan.md](../../planning/transaction_fix_implementation_plan.md)
3. Designed a solution that:
   - Modifies the `CitationGraph.buildFromArchives()` method to accept a `manageTransaction` parameter
   - Updates the `IndexingTrigger.runIndexing()` method to prevent nested transactions
   - Maintains backward compatibility for standalone usage

### Technical Details
The root cause of the issue was identified in the interaction between two components:
- `IndexingTrigger.runIndexing()` starts a transaction
- `CitationGraph.buildFromArchives()` also starts a transaction
- SQLite doesn't support nested transactions

The solution allows the CitationGraph component to work both independently (managing its own transactions) and as part of a larger transaction (deferring transaction management to the caller).

### Implementation Status
- [x] Problem identified
- [x] Solution designed
- [x] Decision document created
- [x] Implementation plan created
- [ ] Code changes implemented
- [ ] Testing completed
- [ ] Deployed to production

### Next Steps
1. Switch to Code mode to implement the changes according to the implementation plan
2. Test the indexing process to verify the fix
3. Update documentation to reflect the changes
