# Context Network Updates [DEPRECATED]

> **IMPORTANT NOTICE**: This file has been deprecated as part of the hierarchical file organization pattern implementation.
>
> **Please use the new updates structure instead**: [Updates Index](./updates/index.md)

## Purpose [DEPRECATED]
This document previously tracked all changes made to the context network. This functionality has been migrated to a hierarchical structure to improve navigation, organization, and scalability.

## Why This File Was Deprecated

This file was migrated to a hierarchical structure because:

1. The updates log was expected to grow significantly over time
2. Updates naturally fall into distinct categories (infrastructure, structure, content)
3. Finding specific updates was becoming challenging
4. The hierarchical structure provides better organization and navigation

## Migration Details

All future updates should be added to the new structure located at:

```
meta/updates/
├── index.md                    # Main entry point with navigation and recent updates
├── infrastructure/             # Infrastructure-related updates
│   ├── index.md                # Index of infrastructure updates
│   └── [individual updates]
├── structure/                  # Structure-related updates
│   ├── index.md                # Index of structure updates
│   └── [individual updates]
└── content/                    # Content-related updates
    ├── index.md                # Index of content updates
    └── [individual updates]
```

## How To Use The New Structure

1. Navigate to [Updates Index](./updates/index.md)
2. Select the appropriate category for your update
3. Create a new update using the item template
4. Add a reference to your update in the category index
5. For significant updates, add a reference in the main updates index

## Legacy Content

The previous content of this file has been preserved for reference during the transition period. However, no new updates should be added here.
