### Project Overview

Research MCP is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation that provides advanced research capabilities. The project uses Perplexity.ai API, DuckDuckGo, and Cheerio to deliver a range of research tasks from basic web searches to deep research reports. It archives all gathered information for future indexing and pre-searching. The implementation is built using FastMCP, a TypeScript framework for rapidly developing MCP servers.

### Vision Statement

To enhance AI assistants with powerful, scalable research capabilities that provide accurate, comprehensive information while maintaining a record of all discovered knowledge.

### Mission Statement

Research MCP provides AI assistants with tools to perform web searches, generate research reports at various detail levels, and archive web content, enabling them to deliver better-informed responses to users while building a knowledge repository for future use.

### Project Objectives

1. Implement a comprehensive MCP server for research tasks using FastMCP
2. Integrate with Perplexity.ai API to generate research reports at multiple levels of detail
3. Provide basic web search capabilities through DuckDuckGo integration
4. Extract and archive web content from various sources (HTML, PDF, DOCX)
5. Automatically archive all research reports and citations for future reference
6. Establish a foundation for future indexing and pre-searching capabilities

### Success Criteria

1. Successful implementation of all research tools (basic search, light/medium/deep reports, URL content capture)
2. Proper integration with the MCP protocol, allowing AI assistants to access all features
3. Efficient archiving of all research outputs and cited sources
4. High-quality research reports that provide accurate, relevant information
5. Positive user feedback on the research capabilities provided by the MCP server

### Project Scope

#### In Scope

- Basic web search functionality via DuckDuckGo
- Multiple levels of research reports via Perplexity.ai API (light, medium, deep)
- URL content extraction and conversion to Markdown
- Support for HTML, PDF, and DOCX documents
- Automatic citation archiving for research reports
- Research query and result archiving
- MCP protocol implementation for all tools

#### Out of Scope

- Direct integration with non-MCP AI systems
- Advanced natural language understanding or processing
- Original content generation beyond research summaries
- Real-time collaboration features
- Full search engine functionality
- Advanced OCR or image analysis
- Direct integration with proprietary databases or paywalled content

### Technologies and Resources

| Technology/Resource | Purpose | Notes |
|---------------------|---------|-------|
| FastMCP | Framework for MCP server development | https://github.com/punkpeye/fastmcp |
| Perplexity.ai API | Generate research reports | Requires API key |
| DuckDuckGo | Basic web search functionality | Public API |
| Cheerio | HTML parsing and extraction | For URL content capture |
| Node.js/TypeScript | Core implementation | Server-side implementation |
| SSE (Server-Sent Events) | MCP protocol transport | For real-time communication |

### Constraints

- Perplexity.ai API rate limits and usage costs
- Public search engine limitations for basic web search
- Processing and storage requirements for archiving
- MCP protocol specification constraints

### Assumptions

- AI assistants can effectively utilize MCP protocol tools
- Perplexity.ai API will remain available and stable
- DuckDuckGo search API will continue to function as expected
- Web content extraction methods will work for most standard websites

### Risks

- API changes or deprecation from third-party services
- Rate limiting or cost increases from Perplexity.ai
- Changes to the MCP protocol specification
- Content extraction challenges from complex or obfuscated websites
- Potential for gathering and storing incorrect or misleading information
